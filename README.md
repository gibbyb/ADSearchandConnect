Active Directory PC Search & Connect is a tool created for the City
of Gulfport IT employees. It requires a few dependancies such as 
Powershell, Dameware, and Track-it to  work completely as intended. 
In fact, this application is very specifically designed for the City 
of Gulfport and probably will not work completely correctly outside 
of its intended use. 

PC Search & Connect allows the user to search the Active Directory for 
all PCs on the domain. You can search by the PC name and description 
which allows you to find the user's PC by simply typing in their name 
or even their job title. Once you have found the PC, you can choose to 
connect to the PC using Dameware. If the description of the user is 
missing or inaccurate, you can edit that desription right from inside 
the program! Once you have finshed helping the user, you can also open 
up track-it and write a new ticket, right from within the app!

In order to run this app, make sure you have an updated version of Java 
Runtime Environment. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory with 
the ADSearchandConnect jar file, and type in 
"java -jar ADSearchandConnect.jar"

That's it!
